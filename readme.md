# buttonLED

This is the first circuit/ code combo I've designed and built on my own.  I have been messing around with [arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/) for a couple of days now and I wanted to see what I could do with one.  I picked up a starter kit that has an arduino uno and a bunch of random parts that you can use to build different sorts of projects.  Upon seeing the seven segment LED component I knew what my first project after general tinkering was going to be.

I set out to build a circuit that upon pressing one button it will count 0 - 9 on the LED.  When the user presses another button a random number will apear.
